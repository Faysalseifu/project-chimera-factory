# Frontend Intent

This document captures the product intent for the operator dashboard and external surfaces.

## Operator Dashboard Goals
- Provide fleet‑level visibility: agent states, budgets, HITL queue.
- Enable fast approvals and overrides.
- Show campaign KPIs and content performance.

## Primary Views
1) **Fleet Overview**
   - Online/offline status
   - Daily spend vs budget
   - Alerts and escalations

2) **HITL Queue**
   - Prioritized decisions with rationale
   - One‑click approve/reject

3) **Campaign Performance**
   - Engagement metrics and trend snapshots
   - Top‑performing assets and actions

## Non‑Goals (Phase 1)
- No full creative suite or editor.
- No complex financial reconciliation UI.
