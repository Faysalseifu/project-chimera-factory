Project Chimera Factory — Daily Report (2026-02-05)

Report scope
- Focus: Task 2 specification and context engineering deliverables.
- Environment: Plain VS Code (Cursor-specific rules removed).

Summary of work completed:

1) Specifications (specs/)
   1.1) specs/_meta.md
      - Replaced previous content with the canonical Task 2 meta spec.
      - Captures vision for autonomous AI influencer factory.
      - Lists core decisions: FastRender swarm, MCP-only access, Redis + Weaviate memory, Coinbase AgentKit on Base.
      - Documents hard rules: spec-first, traceability, TDD, AI disclosure, daily budget enforcement.
      - Stamped with last-updated date (2026-02-05).
   1.2) specs/functional.md
      - Rewrote as functional requirements for operators and autonomous agents.
      - Added operator tasks: define campaign goals, monitor fleet dashboard, approve HITL items.
      - Added agent capabilities: perceive, plan, create content, act, govern self.
      - Documented HITL confidence tiers and escalation triggers for sensitive topics.
   1.3) specs/technical.md
      - Replaced with formal task payload contract (Planner → Redis → Worker).
      - Added judge output schema with confidence and escalation data.
      - Added persistence overview (Postgres, Weaviate, Redis).
      - Included Mermaid ERD for media assets and video metadata.
   1.4) specs/openclaw_integration.md
      - Drafted Phase 1 OpenClaw/MoltBook integration plan.
      - Added heartbeat, mentions ingestion, and success-signal posting as first milestones.
      - Enumerated needed skills and future expansion items.

2) Tooling strategy (research/)
   2.1) research/tooling_strategy.md
      - Reframed to separate developer MCP tools from runtime agent skills.
      - Documented filesystem-mcp, git-mcp, tenx-mcp-sense, sqlite-mcp.
      - Listed planned initial skills roadmap with names aligned to contracts.

3) Skills contracts (skills/)
   3.1) New contract directories created
      - skills/skill_fetch_and_filter_trends/README.md
      - skills/skill_generate_consistent_image/README.md
      - skills/skill_autonomous_usdc_transfer/README.md
   3.2) Each skill README includes
      - Purpose statement.
      - Input JSON schema with required fields and example values.
      - Output JSON schema with expected result fields.
      - Explicit statement that the file is contract-only (no implementation yet).
   3.3) Contract alignment notes
      - Contracts are intended to map to specs/technical.md task payloads.
      - Fields use clear, type-like descriptors for later validation.

4) Plain VS Code workflow cleanup
   4.1) Cursor removal
      - Deleted the .cursor/ folder and any rules file within it.
      - Ensures no Cursor-specific behavior or assumptions in the repo.
   4.2) Root README.md
      - Added manual development rules in README.md.
      - Rules emphasize spec-first work, TDD, MCP-only access, Pydantic typing, async-first patterns.
      - Provides human-readable guardrails for plain VS Code usage.

Repository state notes:
- Legacy skill folders still exist under /skills/:
  - skills/skill_fetch_trends/
  - skills/skill_generate_image/
  - skills/skill_send_usdc_payment/
- These legacy folders predate the new contract set and are not aligned in naming or schema.
- They can be consolidated, renamed, or removed after confirming no dependencies.

Files touched (high-level):
- specs/_meta.md
- specs/functional.md
- specs/technical.md
- specs/openclaw_integration.md
- research/tooling_strategy.md
- skills/skill_fetch_and_filter_trends/README.md
- skills/skill_generate_consistent_image/README.md
- skills/skill_autonomous_usdc_transfer/README.md
- README.md
- .cursor/ (removed)

Quality checks performed:
- Ensured Task 2 canonical text is present in all four spec files.
- Ensured skill contracts include both input and output schemas.
- Ensured Cursor references removed and repo is plain VS Code compatible.

Recommended follow-ups (not executed yet):
- Decide on legacy skill folder cleanup plan (remove or migrate).
- Confirm README.md placement and wording with project owner.
- Start Task 3 (tests, Dockerfile, Makefile, CI) after sign-off.

End of report.
