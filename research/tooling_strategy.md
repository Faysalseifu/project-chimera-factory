# Tooling & MCP Strategy

## A. Developer Tools (MCP servers for YOU in Cursor)
- filesystem-mcp → read/write project files safely
- git-mcp → query commits, diffs, blame
- tenx-mcp-sense → keep thinking trace (required)
- sqlite-mcp → local test DB during dev

Document: connect these via Cursor extensions or terminal when needed.

## B. Runtime Agent Skills (for Chimera agents)
Skills = reusable capability packages (called via MCP wrapper or import)

Planned initial skills:
- fetch_and_filter_trends
- generate_consistent_image
- autonomous_usdc_transfer
