# OpenClaw / MoltBook Integration – Phase 1 Plan

Goal: Let Chimera agents appear in agent social graph for discovery & collabs.

Phase 1:
- Publish heartbeat/status to OpenClaw ("Ethiopian fashion AI influencer – open to sneaker collabs")
- Read mentions in fashion submolts → feed to perception
- Post success signals ("Post got 120 likes!") to build reputation

Needed skills: heartbeat_openclaw, read_moltbook, publish_moltbook

Future: agent-to-agent deal negotiation, micro-payments via wallet
